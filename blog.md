# PreWeek 1 - Failing Forward
###### Walter Saygers 1/28/2021

I am almost complete with the first week of the Awesome Inc U Web Developer Bootcamp and I can say ~~I am now an expert~~ I have struggled everyday! The bootcamp is moving fast, and we have touched on topics ranging from:
1. **CLI** (Command Line Interface or the Terminal)
2. **Git** and **GitHub**
3. **Chrome DevTools**

My experience has deviated from what I thought I would be doing, but I am realizing that my vague understanding of web development was inflated and I know even less than that. I guess you could I thought I knew a byte but I really only knew a bit. I imagined I would be looking at a screen like Neo in the beginning of the Matrix running through lines of code, learning coding languages, and creating content. I am not __The One__ yet. 

Switching from a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to the CLI is giving me the most headache. The application of the CLI is something I am still trying to understand, but I do like the idea of interacting with a computer in a way I never have in the past. Although the CLI is giving me the most problems, it is also what I am most interested in conquering!
Git and GitHub have presented other unique challenges for the week. The Git Learning Bot guided me through several tutorials, and I am beginning to see the application of VCS (Version Control Systems) in real world scenarios. Examples of the tutorials are:
- Branches
- Commits
- Pull Request
- Merges
- Work Flow

I'll finish my first post with a little fun and create an emotional table of my first week. I hope you enjoy!

# PreWeek 2 - Structure and Style
###### Walter Saygers 2/7/2021

I am now two weeks into Awesome Inc U Bootcamp and things are moving quickly. I have jumped off many cliffs and journeyed into several deserts, and I believe I am building my computer literacy. 

My struggles continue to be keeping pace with the program while giving the proper about of time investment to understand the key subjects in the projects we do. The support system consisting of the instructors and my fellow bootcampers is strong, and it is a great source of motivation during these times of struggle. Overcoming these early challenges is increasing my confidence to tackle larger problems that I know will come later.

During Week 3, I will be continuing with JavaScript and taking a deeper dive into pseudo code. Pseudo code is similar to blue prints. You manage your time appropriately and envision a project before typing a single line of code. It seems like an ordeal but I do see the benefits of having a clear target for a finished project. Pseudo code is brainstorming what the code needs to look like and highlighting where potential problems could arise. Pseudo code seems a useful tool and is something I want to have a firm grasp on so I can utilize it with efficacy.

I am excited to jump into JavaScript and put some action into a webpage. The Kata challenges will present a fun and challenging way to boost my knowledge of JavaScript and work with my Code Wars Clan. Looking further into the future of the program and instilling the Agile way into my work flow style is something I am eager to implement. 

# PreWeek 3 - Javascript Intro
###### Walter Saygers 2/14/2021

The bones(HTML), creativity(CSS), and action(JavaScript) combine to create most of the content on the web. While they are separate and each has their own unique importance to the internet, all three are interconnected and need one another to create dynamic and attractive web pages. HTML provides the structure and establishes the layout of the page. CSS gives a web page aesthetic characteristics. JavaScript gives the web page interactive qualities for the users.

My blog incorporates markdown which is similar to HTML as they are both markup languages. Some of the specifics are the body and headers. HTML pages are more intricate with a head section consisting of metadata and elements search engines use. The body has different elements of organization, and a footer can include copyright materials. 

This week we had a pseudo code project. I did my project on hand washing. Pseudo code is new to me and I am looking forward to gaining more experience with it. Its value is in the planning and working out bugs before putting any actual code into a text editor. My greenness with actual code I feel might limit my effectiveness with pseudo code, but I have confidence that as I progress my pseudo code will get stronger as well. 

# PreWeek 4 - Agile and JavaScript
###### Walter Saygers 2/27/2021

This week we took a deeper dive into the Agile Methodology, explored more JavaScript, and worked on two projects. Both projects were JavaScript heavy. In one, we created a digital clock and the other was a countdown timer. 

The Digital Clock Project was pretty cool and definitely has changed how I look at clocks on any computer. I created a Date Object and used getters and setters to initiate a time and update it continuously. I did not know JavaScript had methods to get the time, and it makes me wonder what else I will discover about JavaScript in the coming weeks, months, and years. Google has been a great help and reading as much documentation on markup, design, and programming languages as I can get my hands on. I would like to explore the toLocaleString methods in JavaScript and how to overcome the issues of leap years, time zone changes, and day light's saving.

The Countdown Timer Project was similar to the Digital Clock but had its unique challenges. Creating the timer was straight forward, but I had issues with resetting the timer, displaying in the GUI a place where the user could input a desired time to countdown as well as reset the timer. These little puzzles in each project are challenging but pseudo code and Google along with the resources of Awesome Inc have been life boats in this ocean of new knowledge.

The coming weeks will be filled with struggles, frustration, and triumph! My big takes aways from finishing the prework phase are to complete readings and revisit ideas consistently to cement them, and even more important is to use pseudo code. I need to pseudo code the design of the layout, pseudo code the project in plain english, then pseudo code that plain english to desired structure, objects, methods, and functions in machine talk, and then pseudo code some more!

# Week 1 - Design Heavy
###### Walter Saygers 2/27/2021

Our first week in person is completed and as I reflect, the most painful thorn in my side were the CodeWars Katas. We explored Atomic Design Theory, Bootstrap, and continued with JavaScript but the Katas seemed to get the better of me everytime. My process for solving them went from immediately Googling the kata and then just trial and error of every article and forum I read but that was futile. My next attempts were pseudo code focused and while this organized my thoughts better, it was fruitless at times in how to actually implement what I wanted to do in terms of JavaScript language. I finished the week on the high note completing a Kata with good research, good pseudo code, and better Google questions. Moving forward, my goal is to first think about what the Kata is asking in terms on input and output for 5 minutes, pseudo code in plain english, research that plain english in terms of what JavaScript has to offer, and then tactically dissect the Kata.

The Katas are fun puzzles to complete through out the week and what we learn will be applicalbe to practical tasks, but the main learning points of the week concentrated on the Object orientation of JavaScript and how Atomic Design Theory can be applied to CSS and the CSS framework Bootstrap. 

I would like to do a deeper dive into the methods in JavaScript and discuss some of the more commonly used methods or categorize methods that can perform similarly. 

The Atomic Design paired with the struture of Bootstrap helped conceptualize how to design a page. The concept of Mobile First was stressed and deconstructing the Atomic Design of websites to find its atoms(elements), molecules(several atoms), organisms(several molecules), templates, and pages. The most crucial understanding that helped me survive this week was Container-Row-Column-Content. This helped me visualize and understand how to structure a layout of a page. I want to dive deeper into the responsiveness capabilities in Bootstrap and how page layouts reformat as the viewport changes size.

That's it for this week and upwards and onwards to the next!
