# Week 1 - Failing Forward
###### Walter Saygers 1/28/2021

I am almost complete with the first week of the Awesome Inc U Web Developer Bootcamp and I can say ~~I am now an expert~~ I have struggled everyday! The bootcamp is moving fast, and we have touched on topics ranging from:
1. **CLI** (Command Line Interface or the Terminal)
2. **Git** and **GitHub**
3. **Chrome DevTools**

My experience has deviated from what I thought I would be doing, but I am realizing that my vague understanding of web development was inflated and I know even less than that. I guess you could I thought I knew a byte but I really only knew a bit. I imagined I would be looking at a screen like Neo in the beginning of the Matrix running through lines of code, learning coding languages, and creating content. I am not __The One__ yet. 

Switching from a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to the CLI is giving me the most headache. The application of the CLI is something I am still trying to understand, but I do like the idea of interacting with a computer in a way I never have in the past. Although the CLI is giving me the most problems, it is also what I am most interested in conquering!
Git and GitHub have presented other unique challenges for the week. The Git Learning Bot guided me through several tutorials, and I am beginning to see the application of VCS (Version Control Systems) in real world scenarios. Examples of the tutorials are:
- Branches
- Commits
- Pull Request
- Merges
- Work Flow

I'll finish my first post with a little fun and create an emotional table of my first week. I hope you enjoy!
